        "Welcome to the town of Sunnyvale, whose citizens are obsessed with all things avocado. They put them on their eggs in the morning, in their tacos midday, and transform them into guacamole for the evening. While everyone agrees that guacamole is the best use of their beloved avocado, no one can agree whose guacamole recipe is the best.",
        "Mayor Michelada suggests to have a contest to settle once and for all on who can make the best guac. The town will gather, try each one, and vote for the best!",
        "The day of the competition, the whole town shows up. The entrants, twenty people with big bowls of their family’s pride and joy, gather in the center of the plaza.",

    "Simulation Set Up": [
        "Looking down from Horchata Heaven you are the Guacamole God, and can already clearly spot the winner. Below, well refer to these values as the true scores.",

    "simulation_1": [
        "For illustration purposes, we'll start by giving each judge all guacs and ask them to vote. The winning guac will be the one with the highest score."

#     "transition_1_to_2":    [
#         "The last contest worked well because everyone who participated got to try every single guacamole entrant. But is that realistic? Over two hundred people showed up to join in the fun! Can we have expected that those who entered teh contest made enough guac to feed that many people? Let’s imagine another version of these events.",
#     ],

#     "simulation_2":   [
#         "Mayor Michelada looks around at the huge crowd that’s gathered. He’s thrilled so many people were excited by his idea for a contest, but he’s wishing he had told the entrants to make more guacamole. Will they have enough to go around? Heck, they might run out of chips! He is sweating trying to figure out how they can save the competition. Clearly they’re going to have to limit how many people can participate – there’s just no way for everyone to try everything!",
#         "But how should they pick who gets to be a taster? Well, one of the few things everyone can agree on is that their mom makes the best guac. Maybe just only moms vote? That could work. But people will be upset if they came all this way and don’t get to try any guac. And, truthfully, the Mayor knows his townspeople. They like to have their own say in the matter, especially the younger ones. Almost on principle they’re going to disagree with whatever their parents say!",
#         "Seeing the distress on her Mayor’s face, Earnest Emilia approaches with an idea. She’s just taken an online course in data analytics and really enjoyed learning the clever ways purposeful randomness can useful. What if not everyone needs to try every guac, she suggests. What if, we intentionally let people only try some, but randomly assign a different some to each person?",

#         "The previous contest worked well, to a point. You may have seen that when there is one clear winner among the guacamoles, we can limit how many guacs each voter tastes to a pretty small number. That could help stretch a limited amount of dip across a huge audience of participants. But as the race got closer and closer, limiting the sample of the contest each person gets to try starts to affect the results.",
#         "Our previous simulations also assumed every person had more or less the same opinions of each guac, with slight variations for how hungry or full they were by the time they tried each one. Is that realistic? Let’s try again, and this time meet some of our townspeople!",

#     "simulation_3": [
#         "Up in Horchata Heaven, walking through your fields on celestial cilantro, you wonder for a minute whether the townspeople would agree with your assessment of how the guacamoles compare to each other. You know some people, like Perky Pepe, like guac so much that they’ll probably score every entrant generously. Others, like Finicky Francisca, are quite critical and will have no problem picking out flaws. They’ll probably score things quite harshly. Hopefully, folks like them won’t skew the results too much. The only person you’re really worried about is Cliquey Carlos. He’s the ring leader of a pretty loyal group of farmers. Plus, he always throws the best parties! It’s pretty clear anyone who wants to stay on his good side is going to be voting for him no matter how good his guac actually is.",

#     "condorcet_1":  [
#         "Our Mayor designed the ballots so that tasters score each guac on a scale from one to ten, with one for barely edible and ten for the best guacamole of all time. This was as opposed to asking tasters to sort all the guacs they tried from worst to best. His thinking was that with so many entrants in the competition, keeping track of how all those guacamoles compare to each other would be too mentally taxing. Much easier to simply ask people rate them independently. That way they can just enjoy the guac party and not get all confused keeping track of their ballot. A big assumption baked into this method, however, is that people don’t let their experience with one guac affect their vote of another guac.",
#         "Imagine Pepe, who loves all guac but is trying his best to be a fair voter. The first guac he tries, he just loves. Scores it a nine. The next guac he tries just knocks his socks off. Wow, didn’t know guacamole could be made that good. Scores it a ten. But wait, it’s definitely more that just one point better than that first one. Better revise that down to a seven.",
#         "The problem with our Mayor’s naive attempt at a simple one through ten scale is that no one has a fixed understanding of how good the ten is or how bad the one is. People will naturally develop their mental scale by comparing all the guacs they’ve tried. So, as Emilia explains to him over a late night Topo Chico after the big contest as wrapped up, it’s better to interpret people’s ballots not as raw scores but as implicit rankings.",

#     "condorcet_2": [
#         "This person only got to taste five guacamoles, giving them scores of 8, 4, 4, 6, and 1. From this, it’s probably not right to say Guac#2 is twice as good as Guac#4. But we can definitely say, of the guacamoles that this person got to try, they think #2 was the best, #15 was second best, #4 and #7 were equally mediocre, and #20 was crap.",
#         "So for next year, Emilia suggests, we could use the same ballots, but look at each one as a short list of rankings. Then, instead of adding up all the scores, we collect all the short lists of rankings into one grand list of rankings. We wouldn’t be able to tally by hand anymore; she’ll have to write some code to do it. But that will be even faster anyway!",
#     ],

#     # "Unknown Best":  [
#     #     "What if we don't know who is the best and just decide to go with people's guts? On day 1 of the competition everyone tries all the guacs, and a winner is found. However, the judges realize that trying all guacs turns out to be way too much food. So, on day two they decide to do an experiment. What if we only assign to each judge a random subset of guacs? How small does this subset have to be before the winner identify on day 1 is lost?",
#     # ],

#     # "Conclusion 1":  [
#     #     "When all guacs are relatively similar, the votes end up being very close to each other. As a result, as soon as we start fractioning the guacs it's easy to loose the winner. Try it!"
