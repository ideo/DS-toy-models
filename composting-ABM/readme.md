# About this toy model
In this toy model we use Mesa to simulate the process of a positive behavior (like composting) moving through a neighborhood. Via a streamlit app, we allow the user to explore how
such propagation depends on the level of compatibility between neighbors and a the propensity of neighbors to talk about that behavior with others / adopt the behavior if encouraged to.

# How to run it
- Install the required packages from pipenv via `pipenv install`.
- Run the script via `pipenv run streamlit run sim_app.py`
- Interact with the simulation by clicking on the local URL that appears in the terminal at runtime. You can also share this simulation externally via the network URL.

# Note: Still needs to be tested for user feedback
